New Resources
New resources must be accessible to the higher education sustainability community at large. Examples include original AASHE content, campus sustainability reports, white papers, new magazines or journals, websites, newsletters and videos.
Events
The Bulletin has a wide geographical readership, therefore submitted events must involve significant participation beyond the city or state/province, and must be focused on higher education sustainability or have a major track clearly dedicated to higher education.
For events that do not fit into this guidelines, advertising opportunities are available. Click here to learn more about advertising on AASHE’s website.
Jobs & Internships
Job ad submissions are free for member organizations. Jobs must be directly related to furthering campus sustainability (faculty positions in a sustainability-related field can be included) and have sustainability concepts as part of their job descriptions.

Job opportunities available to students/faculty/staff at only one school, or programs that are not new programs but are just seeking graduates are not accepted. Advertising options are available for jobs, internships and fellowships that do not fit within these guidelines. Click here to learn more about advertising options.
Bulletin Companion Website
The Bulletin’s companion website is an excellent vehicle for publicizing your campus sustainability successes, resources related to campus sustainability, opportunities, regional and online events, and campus sustainability jobs!
AASHE members and non-members may submit items. However, you do have to be logged into AASHE’s website to submit an item. If you do not have an account, you can create an AASHE website account for free.
*Please note that posts typically take two full business days to be reviewed for potential website inclusion.
Curated Bulletin Newsletter
Select submissions from the website will be included in the curated, weekly Bulletin newsletter delivered to your inbox. The Bulletin editor selects submissions that share best practices and communicate innovative and high-impact achievements related to sustainability in higher education. As a result, not all stories will be included in the newsletter.

All stories must be submitted to the website for consideration in the weekly newsletter. To submit an item, click here. Stories submitted and approved by noon Eastern on the Wednesday before the next edition will be considered for inclusion in the upcoming issue.
