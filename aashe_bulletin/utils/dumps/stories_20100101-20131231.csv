That divergence of opinion was most evident among North American students, who were three times as likely as CEOs to state that they expected a significant impact.

While Aspen Trails Ranch is the focus of the students' study, the concept of having a community where energy costs are low, local produce is easily accessible and people can potentially bike or walk to work can be used elsewhere. The tentative plan for Aspen Trails Ranch allows for agricultural land, 650 residences ranging from apartments to single-family homes to business spaces and community centers.

Some estimations toward 100 percent renewable energy include four million, five-megawatt wind turbines and 90,000 large-scale solar plants for which, the pair says, there is no significant economic or environmental constraints on the production of the bulk materials like concrete and steel that this would require. The main bottleneck could be the production of rare earth materials like neodymium for which the worldwide production would have to more than quintuple.

Lisa P. Jackson, the agency's administrator, estimated the total cost of compliance at about $10 billion and said that roughly half of the nation's more than 400 coal-burning plants have some form of control technology installed. Installing and maintaining smokestack scrubbers and other control technology would create 31,000 short-term construction jobs and 9,000 permanent public utility sector jobs. The EPA will take public comment on the proposed regulations for the next several months and anticipates publishing a final rule at the end of this year or early next year. The rule would take effect fully three or four years later. In related news, the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee recently voted a bill through to block EPA climate rules.

Support for Historically Black Universities and Colleges would drop by $85 million under the U.S. House of Representatives' 2011 fiscal year spending bill, which proposes student-aid reductions that would trim the maximum Pell Grant by 15 percent and make 1.7 million students ineligible for the grant. In related news, Inside Higher Ed reports that Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, a California Democrat, recently expressed frustration about the administration's 2012 budget plan proposal to stop letting students who want to study year-round qualify for two Pell Grants in a single year. She wanted to know how this policy made sense in light of Education Secretary Arne Duncan's recent statements that there are two million jobs waiting for American workers to fill. In response, Under Secretary of Education Martha Kanter cited Department of Education research that found only a 1 percent increase in summer school enrollment during the 2010 summer in which the ""two Pell"" program was in place, compared with the previous year.

The professor concluded in an analysis published in the peer-reviewed journal, Climatic Change Letters, that 3.6 percent to 7.9 percent of methane, the chief component of natural gas, is leaking into the atmosphere at various points along the shale gas production life cycle. This would make unconventional natural gas production associated with the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, worse than coal for the climate. This study joins the current media scrutiny surrounding natural gas as many institutions make the switch to natural gas from coal. Environmental advocates, according to this blog post, say that the first step in getting beyond the coal vs. natural gas debate is for the industry to stop refusing to take detailed measure of its methane leakage rates, to make that information public, and to submit to rules requiring them to capture it.",Research

One survey collected responses from 1,055 college leaders from mid-March to mid-April in association with The Chronicle, and the other surveyed a nationally representative sample of 2,142 adults age 18 and older by telephone.

To meet financial challenges and President Obama's goal of having the world's highest proportion of college graduates by 2020, says ""Harnessing America's Wasted Talent"" author Peter M.

The idea bloomed on an especially hot day in 2008, when the temperature was 86 degrees inside and the construction outside was too noisy to open the window. The class treated it as an engineering problem and came up with a green roof as the solution. The roof contains 14,000 square feet of small sedums planted in trays with 4 to 8 inches of soil. The plants act as a natural heat shield, absorbing and deflecting the sun’s radiation. Recent temperature readings revealed that the plants cause the peak temperature of the roof to occur later in the day.",Curriculum

With rallies and walk-outs from classes, students are protesting rising costs of tuition, student debt and weak job prospects. Stating that students at more than 120 institutions have participated in protests so far, the article compares the galvanizing issue to the civil rights and Vietnam War student protests of the 1960s. On the West coast, the University of California, Davis was home to one of the most controversial incidents as students staging a peaceful sit-in were pepper-sprayed by police officers. Students at the University of California, Berkeley who were setting up an Occupy tent city on campus were beaten and arrested by police in riot gear who broke up the encampment. On the East coast, protesters from the Occupy Boston movement, local unions and area colleges marched with the message that higher education is becoming too costly for all but the privileged. Roughly 50 New Jersey City University faculty, staff and students also rallied in protest of state cuts to higher education and the high cost of student loans. In Canada, tens of thousands of university students in Quebec recently demonstrated against a proposed tuition increase of $325 a year over a five-year period. Tuition fees have been frozen for 33 of the past 43 years in Quebec. The planned hike would provide the province with $850 million more in operating revenues.

Pros include the money, research opportunities and new gas industry programs that ""fracking"" (a controversial extraction method for natural gas) would bring. Also tempting is a proposed bill that would allow Pennsylvania's public colleges to keep the money that comes from drilling for gas on their land and use it for energy-efficiency projects or a backlog of deferred maintenance, which stands at $2 billion systemwide. Cons include the environmental, socioeconomic, and public-image implications of pursuing fracking on university land in the face of local community opposition and institutionalized sustainability commitments.
